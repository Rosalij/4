                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The shop is owned by Elias Morren, a lifelong collector of forgotten novels, banned essays, and
                    hand-bound curiosities. Elias is rarely seen on the shop floor, but his presence lingers in every
                    carefully chosen title and every handwritten note tucked between the shelves. <br><br>
                    The staff is a close-knit group of readers and researchers, each with their own specialties—lost
                    poetry, obscure philosophy, midnight fiction, and books that were never meant to be found. They are
                    always happy to guide visitors, though they prefer quiet conversations and thoughtful
                    recommendations over hurried questions.
                    If you know where to look, you’ll know how to reach us.
